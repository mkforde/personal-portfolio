My early career has been shaped by an insatiable curiosity about how complex systems work and how they can work better. What started as fascination with the intricate patterns of animal behavior in neuroscience research has evolved into a passion for optimizing the digital systems that power our modern world. Whether I'm analyzing neural pathways or cloud infrastructure, I'm driven by the same fundamental question: how can we understand these systems deeply enough to make them more efficient, more reliable, and more impactful? This through-line of research-minded thinking and systematic optimization continues to guide my work as I tackle new challenges and explore emerging technologies.
