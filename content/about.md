## Hi, I'm Michael Forde

I'm a Computer Science student at **Columbia University**, deeply passionate about building scalable and efficient systems. From an early age, I was fascinated by technology’s ability to shape the world, whether through software development, problem-solving, or digital innovation. I started programming in high school and quickly became immersed in projects that pushed my understanding of how technology can be leveraged to create impactful solutions. Now, as a university student, I continue to refine my skills, collaborate on projects, and explore new advancements in software engineering.

Beyond academics, I am an advocate for diversity and accessibility in tech. I believe that innovation thrives when people from different backgrounds contribute their perspectives, and I actively engage in discussions and initiatives aimed at making the tech industry more inclusive. My interests also extend into entrepreneurship, where I enjoy exploring how technology can drive meaningful change through startups and new ventures. When I’m not coding or working on projects, you’ll find me playing the double bass, exploring New York City, or writing about my experiences in technology and student life.
